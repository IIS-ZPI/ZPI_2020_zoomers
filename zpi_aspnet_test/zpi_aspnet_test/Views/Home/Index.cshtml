        <h2>Getting started</h2>
        <p>
            Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me
            I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
            She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
            In the shape of an "L" on her forehead

            Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming
            Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
            Didn't make sense not to live for fun
            Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb

            So much to do, so much to see
            So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
            You'll never know if you don't go
            You'll never shine if you don't glow

            Hey, now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
            Hey, now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
            And all that glitters is gold
            Only shooting stars break the mold

            It's a cool place and they say it gets colder
            You're bundled up now wait 'til you get older
            But the meteor men beg to differ
            Judging by the hole in the satellite picture

            The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
            The water's getting warm so you might as well swim
            My world's on fire. How about yours?
            That's the way I like it and I'll never get bored

            Hey, now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
            Hey, now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
            And all that glitters is gold
            Only shooting stars break the mold

            Go for the moon
            Go for the moon
            Go for the moon
            Go for the moon

            Hey, now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
            Hey, now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
            And all that glitters is gold
            Only shooting stars

            Somebody once asked could I spare some change for gas
            I need to get myself away from this place
            I said yep, what a concept
            I could use a little fuel myself
            And we could all use a little change

            Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming
            Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
            Didn't make sense not to live for fun
            Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb

            So much to do, so much to see
            So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
            You'll never know if you don't go
            You'll never shine if you don't glow

            Hey, now, you're an all star, get your game on, go play
            Hey, now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
            And all that glitters is gold
            Only shooting stars break the mold

            And all that glitters is gold
            Only shooting stars break the mold
